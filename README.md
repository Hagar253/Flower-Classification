# Flower-Classification

### Introduction
• In this project we are going to be classifying 104 different types of flowers.
• We will use Convolutional Neural Network; first, we will create our own simple CNN Model then we will use 2 pretrained famous CNN architectures.
• We chose to work with TensorFlow since it provides various methods which will help in preprocessing our data and training our models.
• We will save our weights with each epoch for further training and evaluation.
• Then we will choose the models with the best performance to create an ensemble model.
• Lastly, we will compare all the trained models depending on accuracy and F-Score. Moreover, we will plot the confusion matrices and find the most confusing classes.

### Libraries used
• os: Provides the facility to establish the interaction between the user and the operating  system.
• Numpy: To work with arrays.
• Pandas: To work with dataframes.
• Sklearn: For predictive data analysis, to preprocess the data.
• Matplotlib: For drawing the plots.
• PIL(Python Imaging Library): Enables Python to deal with images.
• TensorFlow: Supports distributed training, immediate model iteration and easy debugging with Keras.
